raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.

assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isnâ€™t.

In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.

except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.

else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.

finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
